Folder to store UZH Projects from Subjects taken in 2020.

## Data Visualization Concepts (DVC):
### Exercise 1: 
The aim of this exercise was to get familiarized with the basic data manipulation techniques using Python, including data cleaning and basic data visualization. 
This exerciseconsisted of visualizing the population size distribution across all age groups in Switzerland, grouped by different cantons.

### Exercise 2: 
The goal of this exercise was to visualize and compare the daily cases increase for each of the cantons in Switzerland from June 2020, such that people can better assess the situation in different cantons.

### Exercise 3: 
The goal of this exercise was to display and link daily total tests numbers together with positive cases numbers in two plots, so that
when dragging the shaded overlay in the second plot, the range of the first plot will be automatically updated.

## Data Visualization Analysis (DVA):
### Exercise 1:
The aim of this exercise was to get familiarized with pandas, bokeh and some basic visualization methods for the purpose of data analysis. 
The task consisted of reading data from a file, process and filter it and present it in a dashboard with different types of visualization methods.

### Exercise 2: 
The aim of this exercise was to practice different dimensionality reduction processes and to learn how to plot them. The task consisted of reading the color information from images, process and filter it and present the images based on their color content in a dashboard, using three different but connected plots.

### Exercise 3: 
This exercise, uses the multivariate data set “Fisher's Iris data set”, with a specific focus on data processing and clustering methods. 
The dataset is presented as two scatter plots, and implements the k-medoids clustering algorithm together with a select widget for random or fixed medoids and a button to run the algorithm.
